# SQL Playground

Used in EECS 484 - Database Management Systems to play around with SQL commands and queries. Not easy as creating a new SQL file and coding, like in Python or C++.

# Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Change only `schema.sql` and `data.sql` to run whatever code you want.
3. Run `./rundb`
